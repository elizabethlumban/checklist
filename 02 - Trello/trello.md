### What is Trello ?

[Trello](https://help.trello.com/article/708-what-is-trello) is a collaboration tool that organizes your projects into boards. In one glance, Trello tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process.

Imagine a white board, filled with lists of sticky notes, with each note as a task for you and your team. Now imagine that each of those sticky notes has photos, attachments from other data sources like BitBucket or Salesforce, documents, and a place to comment and collaborate with your teammates. Now imagine that you can take that whiteboard anywhere you go on your smartphone, and can access it from any computer through the web. That's Trello!

First things first, let's create a [trello account](https://trello.com/signup?returnUrl=%2Fguide%2Ftrello-101).

###  Create a Board

Boards are where projects get organized, information is shared, and great work happens. They give everyone a shared perspective on the work getting done and what still needs to get done. Boards are made up of lists and cards. Lists often represent a workflow or process. Cards, which often represent tasks, move across these lists to completion.

1. From the team’s Boards tab, click “Create new board” or click the plus button (+) in the Trello header directly to the left of your name, and select “Create Board.”

2. Name the board for whatever you are working on.
